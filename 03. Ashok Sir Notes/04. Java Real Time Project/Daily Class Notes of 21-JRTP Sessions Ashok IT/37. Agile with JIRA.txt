What is Software Development Life Cycle ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> The SDLC refers to a methodology

-> SDLC clearly defines the process of creating high-quality software project

-> SDLC methodology focuses on below phases of software development


1) Requirements Analysis

2) Planning

3) Software Design or Architectural Design

4) Development

5) Testing

6) Deployment

7) Support


-> We have several methodologies in SDLC

1) Waterfall Model

2) V-Model

3) Spiral Model

4) Agile Model


+++++++++++++
Waterfall Model
++++++++++++++

-> Waterfall Model introduced in 1970

-> The waterfall Model was the first model that introduced as Process Model.

-> It is a linear or sequential approach to develop software projects

-> It is also called as step By step approach to develop the projects

-> In this model we will comple one phase then we will move on to next phase

++++++++++++++++++
When to use Waterfall
++++++++++++++++++

-> When requirements are fixed

-> When Project is small

-> When budget if fixed


+++++++++++++++++++++++
Dis-Advantages of Waterfall
+++++++++++++++++++++++

-> Risk is high

-> Requirements can't be changed in middle

-> We can't go to previous phase

-> Testing will happen at the end

-> Client involvement is very very less


#################
Agile Methodology
################

-> Agile is one of the SDLC methodology

-> It is a way to manage the project by breaking into several phases

-> Agile is also called as an iterative approach to develop and deliver the project

-> We can achieve continuous development and continuous delivery using Agile Model

-> It involves constant colloboration with stake holders (clients)

-> Continuous improvement at every stage

-> Client Feedback is most critical part in Agile

-> In Agile, Planning, Implementing, Testing and Delivering is a cyclic process
