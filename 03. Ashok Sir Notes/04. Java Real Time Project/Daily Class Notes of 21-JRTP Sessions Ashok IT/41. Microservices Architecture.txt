Monlith Vs Microservices
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Application can be developed in 2 ways

1) Monolith Architecture

2) Microservices Architecture

-> If we develop all the functionalities in one single application then it is called as Monolith Application

++++++++++
Advantages
++++++++++
1) Development is easy
2) Deployment is easy
3) Performance
4) Easy Testing
5) Easy Debugging
6) KT is easy

++++++++++++++
Dis-Advantages
++++++++++++++

1) Single point of failure
2) Whole Application Re-Deployment
3) Scalability ( Increasing & Decreasing resources based on demand )
4) Reliability (Strong)
5) Availability (Zero Downtime)

=> If we develop the functionalities in multiple services/apis then it is called as Microservices Architecture Based Application.

=> Every Microservice will have its own goal

++++++++++
Advantages
++++++++++

1) Loosely coupled
2) Fast Development
3) Quick Releases
4) Flexibility
5) Scalability
6) No Single Point of failure
7) Technology independence


++++++++++++++
Challenges
++++++++++++++

1) Bounded context (identifying no.of services to develop)

2) Lot of configurations

3) Visibility

4) Testing is difficult

5) Debugging
